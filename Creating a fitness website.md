As part of a group assignment, we developed a **fitness-themed web application**. The project allowed us to choose a theme and create a responsive, multi-functional website that adhered to REST principles. Our fitness website included features such as an **exercise library**, a **webshop**, and user authentication with verification emails.

## Objectives

1. Create a multi-page web application with a **responsive design**.
2. Provide a platform for users to explore, purchase products, and learn about the team behind the website.
3. Implement a robust user authentication system, including email verification.
4. Enable users to contact us via a form that sends an email directly to the team.

## Features

### Website Pages
1. **Exercise Library**:
   - A curated list of exercises with descriptions, images, and tips.
   - Search and filter options for exercise types (e.g., cardio, strength).
2. **Webshop**:
   - Products for sale include protein powders, protein bars, and other fitness-related items.
   - Shopping cart feature allowing users to add, remove, and review purchases.
   - Checkout process integrated with confirmation emails.
3. **About Us**:
   - A dedicated page introducing the team behind the website.
   - Highlights our passion for fitness and technology.
4. **Contact Us**: - A form where users can fill in their name, email, and message. - Messages are sent directly to the team via email for quick responses.

### User Authentication
- **Registration & Login**:
  - Users can create accounts and log in securely.
- **Verification Email**:
  - Upon registration, users receive a **custom HTML email** to verify their accounts.

### Administrator Features
- Manage products in the webshop.
- View user registrations and purchase activity.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-End**:
  - Built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactive and responsive design.
  - No external frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) to demonstrate core development skills.
- **Back-End**:
  - Developed with **Node.js** and **Express** for handling server-side logic.
  - RESTful APIs for communication between the front-end and back-end.
- **Database**:
  - SQL database with tables for users, products, and orders.

## Development Workflow

- **GitLab**:
  - Used for version control and project management.
  - Milestones and issues tracked for efficient collaboration.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Each team member contributed to both front-end and back-end development.

## Additional Features (for a team of 4)
- **HTML Email Notifications**:
  - Fully designed verification emails, including branding, colors, and images.
  - Ensures users confirm their registration before accessing the site.

## Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive learning experience in full-stack development. The fitness theme allowed us to build a website that is both engaging and functional, meeting all the project requirements while incorporating additional features like email verification.
