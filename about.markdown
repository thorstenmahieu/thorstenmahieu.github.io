Hi, I'm Thorsten. 
I recently graduated in Industrial Engineering with a specialization in Electronics-ICT from KU Leuven, and I'm passionate about using technology to explore and improve the world around me.

## Interests
My curiosity spans both the scientific and humanistic realms. I’m fascinated by the fundamental principles that govern the natural world—from the intricacies of physics and chemistry to the potential of sustainable energy—and I equally enjoy diving into the social sciences, such as history, geopolitics, linguistics, and culture. This diverse range of interests fuels my drive to understand complex systems and innovate at the intersection of technology and society.

In the world of computer science, I'm particularly drawn to artificial intelligence, recommender systems, data analysis, and full-stack development. I relish tackling programming challenges and crafting solutions that blend analytical rigor with creative problem-solving. My academic projects, including my master’s thesis on AI-based pattern recognition, have given me a solid technical foundation that I’m eager to build upon through practical, real-world applications.

## Hobbies
When I'm not coding, you'll often find me pursuing creative passions. I enjoy playing piano and experimenting with music composition, as well as exploring new culinary recipes through cooking and baking. I also have a keen interest in internet culture and regularly watch educational and entertaining content on YouTube. Additionally, I run a couple of YouTube channels where I share piano covers and discuss Flemish linguistics and culture.

## Personality

## Conclusion
In summary, I am a versatile individual with a broad range of skills and passions, committed to learning, creating, and collaborating. I'm excited to take on new challenges and contribute to projects that drive both technological innovation and cultural enrichment.
