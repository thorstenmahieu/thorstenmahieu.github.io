Hi, I'm Thorsten. 
I recently graduated in Industrial Engineering with a specialization in Electronics-ICT from KU Leuven. I'm passionate about using technology to explore, understand, and improve the world around me.

## Interests

My curiosity spans both the scientific and humanistic realms. On the scientific side, I’m fascinated by how the natural sciences answer fundamental questions about our universe—from the principles of physics like optics, energy, and electromagnetism to the intricate details of chemistry and the structure of matter. I also appreciate aspects of biology, such as evolution and genetics, which provide insights into the processes of life.

In the realm of social sciences, I’m drawn to history, geography, geopolitics, linguistics, and cultural studies. These interests help me understand societal structures, the evolution of cultures, and the dynamics of international relations. I am equally intrigued by philosophy, which challenges me to question the everyday and view the world from multiple perspectives.

In the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) world I'm mostly interested in IT and computer science, as well as sustainable solutions. 
In the world of computer science, I'm particularly drawn to artificial intelligence, data analysis, and full-stack development, as well as understanding how communication networks work. I enjoy tackling programming challenges and crafting solutions that blend creative problem-solving with analytical precision. I like AI because you can gain interesting (often visual) analytical insights.
My academic projects have given me a solid technical foundation that I’m eager to build upon through practical, real-world applications.

Creatively, I have a deep appreciation for music. I enjoy listening to a wide range of [genres](https://volt.fm/user/70l2yye77flm7jrg), from classical to EDM, going over pop and rock. My interest in music also extends to music theory and music history. 

In short, I have a wide range of interests. I enjoy learning how the world works, both on a fundamental scientific level as on a societal level, always questioning the mundane. That understanding of the world fuels my ambition to make practical solutions that contribute positively to society.

## Hobbies
My hobbies are diverse and reflect my broad interests.
I love working on personal coding [projects](projects.md), from building portfolio websites to experimenting with AI-driven side projects.
I also enjoy creative pursuits like playing the piano, something I actively learn through lessons, and [composing](https://musescore.com/user/7253706) music. Cooking and baking are other passions of mine; I love experimenting with healthy, nutritious recipes. Additionally, I’m an avid consumer of thought-provoking [films](https://letterboxd.com/thorst2001/) and series, as well as educational and entertaining YouTube content, mostly about aforementioned interests, as well as internet culture. These activities not only provide relaxation but also continually inspire my creativity and drive for lifelong learning.

## Personality
I am a calm and introspective individual with a strong analytical mind and a passion for continuous learning. My personality aligns with the [INTP](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality) type: curious, logical, and driven to explore complex ideas. I value personal development and enjoy creating tools and solutions that help others understand themselves and the world better. I am both creative and methodical, always seeking to balance innovative ideas with practical, data-driven approaches.

## Conclusion
In summary, I am a versatile and driven individual with a broad range of interests and skills. I am committed to learning, creating, and collaborating to drive technological innovation and cultural enrichment. Whether I’m diving into the depths of AI research or developing user-friendly web applications, I strive to make a positive impact on society.
