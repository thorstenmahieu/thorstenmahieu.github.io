Let me introduce myself:

Hi, I'm Thorsten, an **enthusiastic and versatile person** with a broad interest in the world around me. My curiosity drives me to understand complex issues, both on a **fundamental scientific level** (natural and life sciences) and from a **historical and sociological perspective** (social sciences). I am fascinated by how the world works, from the smallest particles to the structures of societies and the influence of geopolitics.

My interest spans both the **"Liberal Arts"** and **"STEM (Science and Technology)"**. I have a strong affinity with **programming**, especially in the field of **AI, data science and software development**. This interest goes hand in hand with a **creative approach** to problems and a drive to **find technological applications that can have a positive impact on society**. My interest in **sustainable energy and ICT** underlines this solution-oriented thinking.

Besides my technical and scientific interests, I am also **creative** in other areas. I enjoy **cooking and baking**, and I also have a passion for **music**, both listening to a wide range of genres, playing the piano and dabbling in creation, **making piano music, pop music and EDM**. My interest in **films and series** includes genres such as anime, drama, science fiction and fantasy.

My interest in the world is also fueled by my active involvement in **internet culture and YouTube**. I appreciate **educational, humorous and cultural content** on various topics, including geopolitics, history, culture, languages ​​and social issues. The wide list of YouTubers I follow is a testament to my **versatile interest** and my constant search for new insights and perspectives.

I am convinced that my **broad knowledge base, my creative thinking and my solution-oriented attitude** can be valuable assets. I am always **curious** and open to new challenges.
