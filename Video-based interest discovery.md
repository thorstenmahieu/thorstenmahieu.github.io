This project is a **video-based interest discovery tool** designed to help users uncover hidden passions, explore new hobbies, and deepen their understanding of various topics. The system creates a personalized learning experience, making education engaging and natural. It’s especially valuable for students who may need guidance in selecting a major or field of study.  

### How It Works

1. **Video Interaction**:  
   - The system presents random educational videos on a variety of topics.  
   - Users can **like**, **dislike**, or **skip** videos to refine their preferences dynamically.  

2. **Tag-Based Recommendations**:  
   - Tags from liked videos are saved, and the algorithm uses these tags to recommend more videos based on user interests.  
   - Disliked or skipped videos guide the system to explore other topics, encouraging broader discovery.  

3. **Search and Localization**:  
   - Users can search for specific topics or switch languages, providing flexibility and inclusivity.  

4. **Interest Mapping**:  
   - The tool maps user interests over time based on viewing history, offering insights into personal preferences.  
   - This feature is particularly helpful for students considering career paths or selecting a new major.  

5. **Reset Functionality**:  
   - Users can reset their preferences at any time to explore new areas from scratch.  

### Value Proposition for Users 

- **Discover New Passions**: Unearth hobbies or subjects you never knew you’d enjoy.  
- **Engage Naturally**: Learn through interactive and personalized video content.  
- **Personalize Your Journey**: Tailor your learning experience across diverse topics and languages.  
- **Informed Decision-Making**: Map your interests to gain clarity on potential fields of study, helping students make more confident choices about their major.  

### Current Implementation
