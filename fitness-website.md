As part of a group assignment, we developed a **fitness-themed web application**. The project allowed us to choose a theme and create a responsive, multi-functional website that adhered to REST principles. Our fitness website included features such as an **exercise library**, a **webshop**, and user authentication with verification emails.

## Objectives

1. Create a multi-page web application with a **responsive design**.
2. Provide a platform for users to explore, purchase products, and learn about the team behind the website.
3. Implement a robust user authentication system, including email verification.
4. Enable users to contact us via a form that sends an email directly to the team.

## Features

### Website Pages
1. **Homepage**:
   - A welcoming and interactive homepage with a slideshow of images and content.
   - A navigation bar with links to different sections of the website.
