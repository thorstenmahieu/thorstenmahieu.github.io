Hi, and welcome to my personal portfolio webpage!
I'm Thorsten, a software engineer and graduate from KU Leuven. Currently, I am undergoing an individual professional training/internship at [DeDuCo](https://www.deduco.be/).

This website serves as a collection of my projects and interests. To find out more about me, check out the [About Me page](/about)
On the [projects](projects.md) page you’ll find a diverse collection of [school projects](school-projects.md) and personal explorations. These span completed work and ongoing developments. I also have a list with [ideas for the future](ict-ideas.md).

Feel free to explore and discover what I’ve been working on!

\- Thorsten
