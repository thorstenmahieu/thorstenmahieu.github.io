Hi, and welcome to my personal webpage!

Here, you’ll find my portfolio - a diverse collection of [projects](projects.md) from both my [academic journey](school projects.md) and personal explorations. These span completed work, ongoing developments, and [future ideas](ict-ideas.md). You can also find out more about me on the [about me page](about.markdown)

Feel free to explore and discover what I’ve been working on!

\- Thorsten
