title: "Digital Twin of Lab Equipment for E-Learning"
permalink: projects/digital-twin-of-lab-equipment/
---

This project aimed to develop a **digital twin** of laboratory equipment to enhance e-learning for first-year engineering students. The application simulates the behavior and interface of real lab devices, enabling students to practice using a **function generator** and an **oscilloscope** outside of lab hours.

## Objectives

1. Provide a virtual learning tool for students with limited lab experience.
2. Accurately replicate the interface and functionality of lab devices used in the electricity lab.
3. Offer an interactive environment for signal generation and measurement.

## Tools and Frameworks

- **AvaloniaUI**: C# - and XAML-based framework. Used for building the cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Visual Studio 2022**: Chosen for its integration with AvaloniaUI and GitHub.
- **GitHub**: Enabled version control and collaborative development.

## Features

1. **Function Generator**:
   - Generate waveforms: sine, square, triangle, sawtooth, and pulse.
   - Adjust waveform parameters: frequency, amplitude, offset, duty cycle, and symmetry.
   - Visual feedback for active buttons and adjustable output settings.

2. **Oscilloscope**:
   - Display signals generated by the function generator.
   - Adjust vertical and horizontal scaling and positioning.
   - Include a cursor for voltage measurement.
   - Support for AC/DC modes and signal offset.

3. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Tab-based views for function generator, oscilloscope, and an overview of both.
   - Styled buttons and controls to maintain consistency and usability.
   - Tooltip feature for guiding new users.

4. **Signal Processing**:
   - Asynchronous signal generation based on adjustable parameters.
   - Efficient caching to avoid unnecessary recomputation of signals.
   - Adherence to Shannon’s theorem for accurate signal reproduction.

## Results

The application provides:
- A realistic simulation of the lab devices, allowing students to gain hands-on experience remotely.
- An intuitive interface for performing basic tasks in electricity labs.
- Functionality that meets the requirements for first-year students while mimicking the design of the actual equipment.

## Future Improvements

- Add graphical enhancements, such as gridlines and labeled divisions on the oscilloscope.
- Replace sliders with rotary knobs for better usability.
- Introduce advanced features like dual channels, time measurements, and a triggering mechanism.

## Conclusion

This project successfully addressed the challenges of limited lab access by providing a robust e-learning application. While already functional, future updates could further enhance the realism and user experience of the digital twin.
