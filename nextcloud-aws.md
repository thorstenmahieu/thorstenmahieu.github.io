permalink: projects/nextcloud-aws/

As a hands-on exploration of **cloud computing** and **self-hosted file storage**, I set up a **Nextcloud server** on an **AWS EC2 instance**. This project allowed me to get familiar with Amazon Web Services and experiment with Nextcloudâ€™s capabilities as a potential solution for private, scalable file management.

### Setup Overview
The deployment involved:
- Launching an **Ubuntu EC2 instance**
- Attaching an **Elastic IP** for consistent access
- Configuring **firewall rules** to allow key ports
- Registering a **free domain name**
- Installing and configuring **Nextcloud**
- Enabling **HTTPS** for secure access

### Motivation
I started this project to gain practical experience with AWS and deepen my understanding of cloud-based infrastructure. I also wanted to explore the potential of **Nextcloud** as a privacy-focused alternative to commercial cloud storage. My long-term goal is to eventually set up a **home server** for securely storing and sharing family photos and videos, and this project serves as a stepping stone in that direction.
