Because I wanted to experiment with AWS and Nextcloud, I am currently hosting a Nextcloud server on an AWS EC2 instance. 
The setup included:
- Setting up an Ubuntu AWS EC2 instance
- Attaching an elastic IP
- Allowing certain ports
- Getting a (free) domain name
- Installing Nextcloud
- Enabling HTTPS


The reason I want to experiment with AWS is because I want to learn more about cloud computing platforms and I want to experiment with Nextcloud to discover its functionalities to maybe eventually use as a fully fledged home server for my family photos and videos, when I set one up.
