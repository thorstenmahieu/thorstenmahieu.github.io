This project was part of the Project Lab/Master’s Lab course, undertaken in collaboration with the M-Group at KU Leuven. The focus was on the software development and visualization of Human-Centered Executable Safety Cases (HESC) for autonomous systems.

As part of this work, I developed tools for visualizing safety cases using Python and GTK3, and created a digital twin of an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) using ROS. Additionally, I implemented a dashboard for data visualization and prediction algorithms, utilizing Flask, jQuery, and Chart.js.

Due to the project’s non-disclosure agreement (NDA), further details cannot be disclosed. However, the project emphasized software design, real-time data analysis, and user-centered visualization in the context of safety-critical systems.

Technologies used: Python, XML, GTK3, ROS, Ubuntu, remote-desktop, Grafana, InfluxDB, Gazebo, Flask, jQuery, Chart.js
